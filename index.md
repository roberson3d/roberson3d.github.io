  Welcome! I'm a software developer for video games in the Chicago area.
  
  I appreciate being a contributing member of a team, working autonomously, and collaborating with other disciplines. With a strong multidisciplinary background and abilities, I am able to creatively solve many art and engineering challenges. My skills allow me to float between engineering and tech-art roles where I like gameplay, tools, systems development, UI, build systems & CI, and shaders.
  
  Outside of programming, I find myself drawn to activities that explore fantastical worlds. Opening a fantasy or sci-fi novel will consume all my free time until I get to that final page. Strategizing through a board game is a favorite way to hang out with friends. Crafting hand drawn maps, painting mini-figs, link-surfing Wikipedia for background ideas, and managing a relational database of all my session notes gets me through the TTRPG downtime.

## Synapse Games, Inc and Kongregate Inc

**Senior Client Engineer** March 2014 - present.

Client engineering responsibilties at Synapse run the gamut for anything related to making the game's front end app. My tasking included working closely with all departments to: implement new features, UI layout, combat systems, handle data and communication with server, fix bugs, maintain plugins and engine, update build systems CI/CD, and improve performance.

### TMNT: Mutant Madness

**Hero collector RPG.**

TMNT: Mutant Madness builds on the learnings from Rift Heroes. The combat system was my primary focus in this game and mostly authored myself. Additionally, I manage the our build system and CI/CD tools for this project, implement new features, and build out UI.

### Rift Heroes

**Fantasy hero collection with base building.**

Rift Heroes was the second Synapse project where I was a core engineer. It was a more experimental for the company, so in addition to feature and UI work, I built a variety of combat prototypes. 

### Spellstone

**Fantasy collectable card game.**

Spellstone was built off of the technology from Synapse's previous CCG, Tyrant Unleased. I was the main engineering responsible for updating, improving, or rebuilding old systems to work within the new design as well as introducing new features to the game.

### Other Titles

**Unannouced Title**

**Castaway Cove**: Idle clicker with hero collection.
