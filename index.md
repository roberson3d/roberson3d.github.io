  Welcome! I'm a software developer for video games in the Chicago area.
  
  I appreciate being a contributing member of a team and collaborating with other disciplines. With a strong multidisciplinary abilities, I creatively solve art and engineering challenges. My skills allow me to float between engineering and tech-art roles. I enjoy gameplay, tools, systems development, UI, build systems & CI, and shaders.
  
  Outside of programming, I find myself drawn to activities that explore fantastical worlds. Opening a fantasy or sci-fi novel will consume all my free time until I get to that final page. Strategizing through a board game is a favorite way to hang out with friends. Spending my ttrpg downtime crafting hand drawn maps, painting mini-figs, or updating a Notion database of session notes.

<!--**Fantasy hero collection with base building.**-->
  * Prototyped and championed several combat systems, including the final design.
<!--Rift Heroes was the second Synapse project where I was a core engineer. It was a more experimental for the company, so in addition to feature and UI work, I built a variety of combat prototypes.-->

  * Implemented the studio's only live PvP mode, allowing players to play against another player in real time
