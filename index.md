## Synapse Games

**Senior Software Engineer** March '14 - present.

Engineering responsibilties at Synapse run the gamut once things get in engine (Unity). My tasking included working closely with all departments to: implement new features, UI layout, handle data and communication with server, fix bugs, maintain engine and plugins, update build systems with CI, and improve performance.

### TMNT: Mutant Madness

TMNT: Mutant Madness builds on the learnings from Rift Heroes. The combat systems were my primary focus in this game and mostly authored myself. Additionally, I manage the our build system and CI tools for this project, implement new features, and build out UI.

### Rift Heroes

Rift Heroes was the second Synapse project where I was a core engineer. It was a more experimental for the company, so in addition to feature and UI work, I built a variety of combat prototypes. 

### Spellstone

Spellstone was built off of the technology from Synapse's previous CCG, Tyrant Mobile. I was the main engineering responsible for updating, improving, or rebuilding old systems to work within the new design as well as introducing new features to the game.

### Castaway Cove

While working on this game, I've covered several areas developing the camera system, a plug-in for Xbox controller support, most non-standard shaders, helped with some of the character rigging, various other gameplay scripts, and working on mobile controller support.
