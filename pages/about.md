## About Me
  I am a video game developer located in the Chicago area. For the past eight years, I've developed mobile games at Kongregate as a client engineer. Primarily, my role is to build the front end app giving me a wide range of tasking. I often build game screens, gameplay features, and core combat systems. Additionally, I fill in pipeline gaps by creating tools, automating builds and other processes, and handling platform store setup. 
  
  I appreciate being a contributing member of a team and collaborating with other disciplines. With strong multidisciplinary abilities, I creatively solve art and engineering challenges. My skills allow me to float between engineering and tech-art roles. I enjoy gameplay, tools, systems development, UI, build systems & CI, and shaders.
  
  Outside of programming, I find myself drawn to activities that explore fantastical worlds. Opening a fantasy or sci-fi novel will consume all my free time until I get to that final page. Strategizing through a board game is a favorite way to hang out with friends. Spending my ttrpg downtime crafting hand drawn maps, painting mini-figs, or updating a Notion database of session notes.
