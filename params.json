{"name":"Ricky Roberson","tagline":"game programmer, hard worker, fantasy explorer","body":"## Synapse Games\r\n\r\n**Senior Software Engineer** March '14 - present.\r\n\r\nEngineering responsibilties at Synapse run the gamut once things get in engine (Unity). My tasking included working closely with all departments to: implement new features, UI layout, handle data and communication with server, fix bugs, maintain engine and plugins, update build systems with CI, and improve performance.\r\n\r\n### TMNT: Mutant Madness\r\n\r\n**Hero collection and battler.**\r\n[trailer&rarr;](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=abf4_cTto00)\r\n\r\nTMNT: Mutant Madness builds on the learnings from Rift Heroes. The combat systems were my primary focus in this game and mostly authored myself. Additionally, I manage the our build system and CI tools for this project, implement new features, and build out UI.\r\n\r\n### Rift Heroes\r\n\r\n**Fantasy hero collection with base builder.**\r\n[trailer&rarr;](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vLtrtsnP77A)\r\n\r\nRift Heroes was the second Synapse project where I was a core engineer. It was a more experimental for the company, so in addition to feature and UI work, I built a variety of combat prototypes. \r\n\r\n### Spellstone\r\n\r\n**Fantasy collectable card game.**\r\n[trailer&rarr;](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-RbpLFSfie4)\r\n\r\nSpellstone was built off of the technology from Synapse's previous CCG, Tyrant Mobile. I was the main engineering responsible for updating, improving, or rebuilding old systems to work within the new design as well as introducing new features to the game.\r\n\r\n### Castaway Cove\r\n\r\n**Idle clicker with hero collection.**\r\n[trailer&rarr;](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vSJknYiFBAo)\r\n\r\nI assisted in building new feature and UI implementation.\r\n\r\n### Global Assault\r\n\r\n**Squad-based RPG.**\r\n[trailer&rarr;](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dypCdF9AoBM)\r\n\r\nI assisted in building new feature and UI implementation.\r\n\r\n***\r\n\r\n## The Amiable\r\n\r\n**Co-founder, engineer** June '13 - June '16\r\n\r\n### Tetrapulse\r\n\r\n**Co-op**\r\n[trailer&rarr;](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbY8QGYbzwA)\r\n\r\nWhile working on this game, I've covered several areas developing the camera system, a plug-in for Xbox controller support, most non-standard shaders, helped with some of the character rigging, various other gameplay scripts, and working on mobile controller support. \r\n\r\n***\r\n\r\n## Depaul University\r\n\r\n**B.S.
